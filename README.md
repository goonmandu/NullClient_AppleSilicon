# NullClient 0.0.3 for Apple Silicon

This is a fork of [CrafterL](https://github.com/CrafterlKrunker)'s [NullClient](https://github.com/CrafterlKrunker/NullClient) v0.0.3.  
This repository contains the files I used on my M1 MacBook Air 13" to build the Electron app for AArch64 macOS.  
I will update this to 0.2.5 or later versions as the source code is released on their repository.
